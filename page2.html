        <div class="col">Generally, Schildt’s guide is considered to be among the 3 or at least 5 best books for Java beginners. But this book requires a little bit more understanding of programming comparing to the previous sources. It will deepen your understanding of Java origins and its relations to other programming languages.
          <br>
          <br>
          It is profound research about the core concepts of Java which explains the code by line and guides you from the basic understanding of data types, classes and objects to more complex concepts like lambda expressions and functional interfaces. The great part of this book is a self-test section at the end of each chapter.
          <br>
          <br>
          Pros: a plain tone of voice, self-testing, full coverage of Java core.
          <br>
          <br>
          Cons: you need at least a small prior understanding of programming.

              <p>These are completely safe sources for ones that only start to learn coding in Java. We advise you to have a look at all of them, because they use different approaches in presenting core concepts. When you get stuck with a certain topic in one book, the chances are strong that you will get a clear explanation somewhere else.</p>
