        <div class="col">You have all the right to be skeptic about “the dummies series” since they are of no use for readers with even a minimal experience and understanding of any subject. But due to the plain language, they explain the main terms simply without any confusions. You will learn the major things you need to start with Java coding, like how to install Java, compile code and complete different practical exercises after you finish the reading. It is as easy as books for kids.
          <br>
          <br>
          Pros: very simple examples and lots of “how-tos” if you have no idea of programming concepts.
          <br>
          <br>
          Cons: nothing more than a plain introduction in Java.

              <p>These are completely safe sources for ones that only start to learn coding in Java. We advise you to have a look at all of them, because they use different approaches in presenting core concepts. When you get stuck with a certain topic in one book, the chances are strong that you will get a clear explanation somewhere else.</p>
